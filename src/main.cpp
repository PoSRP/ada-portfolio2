/**
 * ADA Portfolio 2
 *
 * 1 Knight Problem
 *   Jakob and Jens are playing chess and they want to figure out what is
 *   the minimum number of moves it takes for a knight at a given position
 *   to reach another position.  The legal moves of a knight can be seen in
 *   figure 1. Your method should work for arbitrary sizes of chess boards.
 *   To solve this problem, you must implement your own classes, Tree and
 *   Node. You should also provide a public method that allows your
 *   instructor to test your work.
 *   Just as shown below:
 *     int minimum_steps(int board_height,
 *                       int board_width,
 *                       int knight_start_x_position,
 *                       int knight_start_y_position,
 *                       int knight_end_x_position,
 *                       int knight_end_y_position)
 *   An example could be for the knight in figure 1, then the input would be:
 *     minimum_steps(8, 8, 4, 4, 3, 2);
 *   You do not have to write your own driver.
 *   Just make sure that your codecomplies with the previously mentioned
 *   interface.
 *
 * 2 Formalia
 *   You  should  only  hand  in  ONE  file  in  the  form  of  .zip.
 *   The  name  of  the  file should be your SDU username (e.g.  jeive17).
 *   In the .zip-file, you include all the relevant source (.cpp, .h, .hpp,
 *   .java).  So only the programming languages C++and Java is acceptable and
 *   use only the standard libraries.  So your program should be able to
 *   compile using a standard compiler. The portfolio should be completed and
 *   handed in individually.
